# Crime Detection System 🔍🚨

A comprehensive crime detection and monitoring system powered by artificial intelligence and real-time data processing.

## 📋 Overview

The Crime Detection System is a full-stack application designed to detect, analyze, and report criminal activities using advanced AI/ML algorithms. The system integrates multiple components including an AI server for intelligent detection, a robust backend for data management, and an intuitive frontend for user interaction.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

```
CrimeDetectionSystem/
├── ai-server/          # AI/ML models and detection algorithms
├── backend/            # Backend API and business logic
├── frontend/           # User interface and client application
├── functions/          # Firebase Cloud Functions
└── firebase.json       # Firebase configuration
```

### Components
